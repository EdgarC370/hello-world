Hello to anyone reading this!

I'm Edgar, currently a Cloud Support Engineer I at AWS, the first role I accepted after graduating from Florida Atlantic University in 2021 with a major in Computer Science. At AWS my role is within the Database domain, primarily focused on supporting customers' RDS PostgreSQL, RDS Oracle, and Aurora PostgreSQL. I additionally am responsible to support DocDB with MongoDB compatibility and Timestream, and also handle a high volume of DMS cases involving any of these engines as the source, constantly resolving errors in migration and replication latency.

I started as a Cloud Support Associate out of college and quickly was promoted to Engineer. My responsibilities have expanded to include supporting Level II and III support specifically for RDS Oracle, RDS PostgreSQL, and Aurora PostgreSQL where I guide other support engineers who require additional assistance for technically complex cases.

I have various private projects that I am working on but I am hosting locally as I am a self-hosting enthusiast and look forward to moving to a fully FOSS environment long term.

Please reach out to me on LinedIn if you have any PostgreSQL questions, or want to discuss the AI future!
