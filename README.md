Hello to anyone reading this!dbpo d

I'm Edgar, currently a Cloud Support Engineer I at AWS, the first role I accepted after graduating from Florida Atlantic University in 2021 with a major in Computer Science. At AWS my role is within the Database domain, primarily focused on supporting customers' RDS PostgreSQL, RDS Oracle, and Aurora PostgreSQL. I additionally am responsible to support DocDB with MongoDB compatibility and Timestream. 

I started as a Cloud Support Associate out of college and quickly was promoted to Engineer. My responsibilities have expanded to include supporting second level support specifically for RDS Oracle where I support other support engineers who require additional assistance for technically complex cases where they struggle to resolve the customer’s issue with the existing documentation.

I’m working now on my GitHub to showcase the talents that are not being exercised within my current role at AWS, specifically the interest I have in programming and in Web3, please feel free to explore, and if you’d like please reach out to me!
